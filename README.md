# about
i developed a global recipe website with over 30 recipes from over 10 cuisines. i made this project because i thought it would be a cool idea, plus i'm really into cooking/baking! this was also made as apart of hackclub's athena award.

# development
i made my project using html, javascript, and css in vscode. i collected some recipes from different websites (some of them being my own!), and sorted each into a different cuisine page.

# struggles
1. i honestly had so many struggles with this project. first, the layout was honestly so annoying to figure out. it looked so wack at first, but i got there after some trial and error. 
the next issue i had was working on the sliders for each cuisine page. honestly, i could've removed them but i thought it was a cool feature to add, so i stuck with it. i actually learned a lot after going thru the process, and i'll probably add a feature like that in future projects. same with the dropdown! i struggled a lot at first but once i figured out what to edit in/out, it felt soooo nice.

2. i also struggled so much with the personality quiz i worked on (and eventually scrapped). it got so confusing and i was crashing out everyday wondering why i had so many errors LOL. i'm so new at javascript, and my dreams were too big for this one. i'm going to try making a seperate project for this in the future, once i learn some more about js.

3. there's also a bit of an issue surrounding the recipe cards. when i would click on them, they'd display each card and i was so confused. i managed to fix this, but then the issue was that you'd have to click the cards left to right in order to see the correct recipe.

obviously there's still so much to fix with this, but i'm at a point where i feel like i can showcase this to other people. i'm def going to continue working on this though!
